**Keywords**: OpenML, Machine Learning, Online Platform, Collaboration

# Aim
*OpenML* [@Vanschoren2014openml] is an online platform for collaborative
machine learning. Users can upload, organize, search and download data sets,
machine learning tasks and algorithms. In this tutorial we want to introduce
*R* users to the **OpenML** *R* package [@Casalicchio2017openml] and show how
everyone can easily contribute and make use of *OpenML*. 

# Tutorial content
In this tutorial we want to introduce you to the OpenML platform and the *R*
package. We want to work hands-on. The outline is as follows:

- Overview 
- Becoming a member
- **OpenML** and **mlr**
- The *R* package
    + Installation and configuration
    + Listing information
    + Downloading **OpenML** objects
    + Creating runs 
    + Uploading and Tagging
    + Further features
- Your first OpenML project


# Target audience and pre-requesites
The only pre-requesite you should have is a very basic understanding of R.  We
aim to address a broad audience, since OpenML is interesting for all kinds of
people. OpenML is interesting for people who 

- have data (possibly with a prediction task they can't solve on their own), 
- analyse data, 
- develop algorithms, 
- want to learn about machine learning, or 
- teach machine learning.
