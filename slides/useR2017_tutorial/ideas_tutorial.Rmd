# Info

- 3 hours
- audience: R users
- 8 morning tutorials, 8 afternoon tutorial
- People who are fast in the practicals can check out https://www.openml.org/guide



# Structure

## Intro to openml.org 
> Resources:  
> [NIPS slides](https://github.com/openml/articles/blob/master/OpenML%20NIPS.pdf)

- Why, what, how, who, for whom
- Data sets, tasks, flows, runs


----

*Practical*

- Get an openml account (if you don't have one yet)    
- What is the best algorithm on the supervised regression task with the most runs? 
- You received a data set ID. Create a sensible task for this data set. ([not yet possible](https://github.com/openml/website/issues/96))

### Installation and configuration

----

*Practical*

- Install the OpenML R package (if you haven't done so yet)
- Add your API-key to your config file



### Listing

----

*Practical*

- List all regresssion tasks corresponding to data sets with between 
  50 and 55 observations.

### Downloading

----

*Practical*

- Download task with task ID XXX
- Download the task you created earlier.

### Running (short intro to mlr)

----

*Practical*

- Run your favorite learner/algorithm (from mlr) on task XXX that you already downloaded.
Hint: use `listLearners()` to find learners.




### Uploading

----

*Practical*

- Upload your run to OpenML. Add the tag "useR17". 
- Check if the upload worked by going to the website. Also check if the tag was
  added (you can also still add it on the website).
