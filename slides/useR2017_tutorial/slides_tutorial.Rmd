- If you haven't done so yet, create an account on [OpenML.org](www.openml.org).

- If you haven't done so yet, install the OpenML R package and one of the packages farff or RWeka:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("OpenML")
install.packages("farff")  # or install.packages("RWeka")
```



- If something is not clear / you have a question / you have a problem, please **let us know**!

- We will have lots of practicals, if you are faster than others, you can 
check out https://www.openml.org/guide or help others.

## Intro to openml.org 
<!-- [15 minutes, Joaquin] -->

> Resources:  
> [NIPS slides](https://github.com/openml/articles/blob/master/OpenML%20NIPS.pdf)

- Why, what, how, who, for whom
- Data sets, tasks, flows, runs (all have their own website)
- vocabulary: features = covariates, number of observations = number of instances, ML = Machine Learing (not maximum likelihood)

class:inverse

### *Practical*  
<!-- [5 minutes, Jouaqin] -->

- Install the OpenML R package (if you haven't done so yet)
- Add your API-key to your config file



---
### Listing 
<!-- [7 minutes, Jouaqin] -->

---
class:inverse

### *Practical*  
<!-- [5 minutes, Jouaqin] -->

- List all regresssion tasks corresponding to data sets with between 
  50 and 55 observations.

### Intro to mlr 
<!-- [15 minutes, Bernd] -->

---
### Running and uploading 
<!-- [10 minutes, Bernd] -->

---
class:inverse
### *Practical*  
<!-- [25 minutes, Bernd] -->

- Run your favorite learner/algorithm (from mlr) on task XXX that you already downloaded.
Hint: use `listLearners()` to find learners.
- Upload your run to OpenML. Add the tag "useR17". 
- Check if the upload worked by going to the website. Also check if the tag was
  added (you can also still add it on the website). 
- Check the website on how well you did
